## What it should do

- Easy integration of brainflow library to Unity
- Ready made prefab or script file which allows drag and drop style usage
- Developer should only need to specify the following
  - EEG board name (boardId in brainflow)
  - Info on how the app connects to the EEG board (mac address or name of the EEG device)
    - This part might not be needed unless there are a lot of devices within reach of the BT receiver
- The prefab/script outputs a number representing the level of stress

  - Do I even need to worry about this?
  - Brainflow docs state this:  
  `After building your game for production donâ€™t forget to copy Unmanaged(C++) libraries to a folder where executable is located.`
- Need to train a model
